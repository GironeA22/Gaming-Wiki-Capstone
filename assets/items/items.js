        description: "Chopping wood: An axe is used to break logs and blocks derived from wood faster than by using other tools. An axe uses 1 durability to break 1 block. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability. Stripping: Using an axe on a log, wood block, or block of copper causes it to become a stripped log, stripped wood block, or removes one layer of oxidization or wax, respectively. This consumes one point of durability from the axe. Weapon: An axe loses 2 points of durability when used as a weapon. Bedrock Edition: In Bedrock Edition, axes always attack instantly and deal 1â™¥ less damage than a sword of the same quality but it lowers the durability of armor and shields faster than any other tool in-game. Java Edition: Attacking a shield user with an axe has a chance to disable the use of the shield for 5 seconds. The base chance is 25%, plus 5 percentage points per level of Efficiency on the axe, plus 75 percentage points if attacking while sprinting. Vindicators, piglin brutes, or other mobs with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a sword of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to recover. The damage dealt and cooldown time depends on the type",

        name: 'Waxed Weathered Cut Copper Stairs',
        description: "Placement: To place stairs, use a stairs item while pointing at a surface facing the space the stairs should occupy. When placed, a stair orients itself with the half-block side closest to the player. Stairs change their shape to join with adjacent stairs (of any material): When a stairs' 'half-block side is adjacent to the side of another stairs, the stairs' full-block side wraps into an 'L' shape to join the other stairs (it creates an 'inner corner'). When a stairs' full-block side is adjacent to the side of another stairs, the stairs' full-block side shortens to join the other stairs' full-block side (it creates an 'outer corner'). Right side up stairs do not join with upside-down stairs and vice versa. Walking: Walking up stairs is faster than jumping up the same distance. Walking up a stairway doesn't cost any exhaustion from the player's hunger bar, compared to 0.2 exhaustion per jump. Therefore, walking up stairs doesn't make the player hungry at all. Behavior: Generally, the solid faces of stairs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, transparent blocks that need to placed on an opaque surface can be placed on these faces. Fuel: Wooden stairs can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block. Note blocks: Wooden stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce 'bass' sound. Stone stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce 'bass drum' sound.",

        description: "Obtaining: Swaggiest stairs ever are available in the creative inventory, and naturally generate in the 'missing' dimension. Breaking: Swaggiest stairs ever require a diamond or netherite pickaxe to mine. If it is mined with anything else, it drops nothing. Natural generation: Swaggiest stairs ever naturally generate in the 'missing' dimension as the stairs leading up to the chest containing the footprints.",
